 * row, so an edit lands everywhere at once with nothing to push.
 *
 * The copy below is kept as the fallback for exactly one situation: nothing has
 * been published yet, and the endpoint answers 404 / NOT_PUBLISHED. A legal page
 * that renders empty because an API call failed is worse than a legal page
 * showing slightly stale wording, so the bundled text stays until it is
 * deliberately replaced. Once an admin publishes once, the API wins forever.
 *

          we do not vet the people you meet. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility
          to perform your own due diligence, just as you would when meeting anyone from the internet.
          You must independently investigate, verify, screen, and evaluate any person you encounter
          through the Platform before entering into any arrangement. This includes conducting your own
          background checks, verifying references, confirming identity, and verifying any claimed
          certifications. You must use common sense and personal judgment at all times.

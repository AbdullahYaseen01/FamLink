// the preview image in a Facebook post and the text under it all have to say the

// "the same thing" is — which fields appear, in what order, worded how. Change a
// meta row here and every non-React surface follows.

// this loads in a Node function and an edge runtime alike.

// Same alphabet and bounds as the minted token (backend/Services/utils/
// shareProfile.js). Lives here because both functions validate before spending
// an API call on a path someone typed by hand.

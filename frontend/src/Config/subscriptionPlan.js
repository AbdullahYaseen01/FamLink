// The one and only FamLink subscription plan.
//
// Every user gets the same plan, whatever their profile type: there is no
// separate Nanny / Family tier and no per-role Stripe price. The upgrade modal
// (SubscriptionModal.jsx), the settings page (SubscriptionSettings.jsx), the
// pricing page (Price/pricing.jsx) and the card form (subComponents/Billings.jsx)
// all read the name, price, features and priceId from here, so a change here is
// a change everywhere. Do not reintroduce a `nanny ? … : …` branch around any
// of these values.

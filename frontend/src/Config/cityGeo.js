// Geo + SEO lookup for the programmatic city/neighborhood landing pages
// (Category 4.1). Maps a URL slug (e.g. "oakland-ca" or "rockridge") to a map
// center + zoom so the Leaflet map can render without a geocoding round-trip,
// plus the SEO fields the prerender script (scripts/prerender-meta.mjs) and the
// internal-linking components need. This file is imported by Node at build
// time — keep it plain JS with no JSX/asset imports.
//
// Per entry:
//   canonicalSlug — the ONE slug we want indexed (cities keep their "-ca"
//                   suffix to match the sitemap/footer URLs; neighborhoods are
//                   bare). resolveCityGeo() accepts suffixed variants but the
//                   canonical always points here.
//   parent        — cityGeo key of the containing city (neighborhoods only).
//   blurb         — unique intro copy behind the meta description, so the ~20
//                   templated pages don't all read identically to Google. It is
//                   NOT rendered on the page any more (marketing removed the
//                   on-page intro brief) — keep it unique per entry anyway,
//                   that's the whole point of it.
//   coverage      — the family / caregiver / area counts the coverage map
//                   publishes for this page, plus the `spots` the circles are
//                   drawn on. Set here, these override the live
//                   /location/map-pins response: marketing owns the numbers
//                   these launch pages show. Entries WITHOUT a coverage block
//                   still render whatever the API actually reports.
//
// About `spots`: every one is a REAL residential neighborhood, hand-picked. A
// generated ring or spiral cannot do this job here — half the Bay Area ring
// around any of these centres lands in the Bay, on Tilden/Redwood Regional
// parkland, or on open hillside, and a coverage circle sitting on open water
// reads as obviously fake. Two rules when editing:
//   • Centres go on inhabited ground. No bay, no estuary, no regional park,
//     no ridgeline.
//   • Keep any two spots on a page apart — the drawn radius is derived from
//     the closest pair (see NannyShareMap) so circles never overlap, which
//     means one tight pair shrinks every circle on the page.
// First spot listed carries the largest share of the families.
//
// Coordinates are approximate neighborhood centroids — precision isn't critical
// because the pins themselves are intentionally fuzzed.

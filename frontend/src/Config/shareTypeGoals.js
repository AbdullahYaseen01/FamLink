// The four share types as plain data: role, goal wording, accent colors.
//
// Split out of shareTypeTheme.jsx (which still re-exports it, so every existing
// import keeps working) because two consumers now need this without React: the
// serverless renderer that writes a shared link's Open Graph tags, and the edge
// function that draws the preview image. Both run outside the browser, and
// shareTypeTheme.jsx pulls in lucide-react for its JSX badges — an icon set has
// no business in an edge bundle.
//
// Keep this file free of imports. That is what makes it safe to load from a
// function, and the reason the wording can't drift between the app and the image
// a stranger sees in a Facebook group.

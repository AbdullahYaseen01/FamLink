// The framing matters as much as the wording: a shared page is FamLink
// presenting an available nanny share, not a member advertising themselves.
// That's why every headline names what the share is *missing* ("Another family
// needed") rather than who is asking, and why the subheadline spells out the
// arithmetic — a reader who has never heard of a nanny share needs to see that
// it takes two families and one nanny before the CTA means anything.
//
// The variant keys match src/Config/shareTypeTheme.jsx and the `variant` the
// backend puts on the public payload (Services/utils/shareProfile.js).
//
// `shareText` takes the neighborhood because "in Rockridge" is what makes
// someone stop scrolling a Facebook group — each variant slots it in itself
// rather than having a caller splice it into a finished sentence.

// Versioned Terms & Conditions (and the other legal documents that behave the
// same way).
//
// The requirement is that editing the terms updates them everywhere the
// platform shows them. The reason that isn't automatic today is that the copy
// lives in a React component (frontend/src/Components/Authority/Terms&Condition.jsx)
// and is quoted again in half a dozen checkboxes and onboarding screens, so
// changing it means a deploy and finding every copy.
//
// So the document moves into the database and every surface reads it from one
// endpoint. Propagation is then not a feature that has to work — it is the only
// possible behaviour, because there is one row to read.
//
// APPEND-ONLY. Publishing an edit writes a NEW document and demotes the old one
// rather than overwriting it. Terms are the thing a user agreed to at a moment
// in time; if a dispute turns on what the text said in March, an UPDATE would
// have destroyed the only answer. `User.termsVersion` records which version
// each person accepted, and that reference is worthless if the old row is gone.

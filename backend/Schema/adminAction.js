// An audit trail of everything an admin does through the console.

// The console can block an account, delete a profile, wipe a user, read private
// messages and mail every address in a city. Those are exactly the powers that
// need to be attributable: not because admins are suspected, but because
// "someone deleted this family's account last Tuesday" has to have an answer,
// and because a shared admin login with no trail is indistinguishable from a
// compromised one.
//
// Written by `logAdminAction` (Services/utils/adminAudit.js) at the point each
// destructive route succeeds. Read-only from the API — there is no route that
// edits or deletes a row here, and there should never be one.

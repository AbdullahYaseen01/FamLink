// First-party web analytics: one row per page view.
//
// Everything the traffic and page-usage screens report — visits, unique
// visitors, sources, top pages, session duration, bounce rate, drop-off — is
// derived from this one collection by aggregation. There is no separate
// "sessions" table: a session is a group of rows sharing a `sessionId`, and
// deriving it means the two views can never disagree about what a session was.
//
// PRIVACY. This is a site used by families with young children, so the
// collection is built to be un-deanonymisable by design rather than by policy:
//
//   * No IP address is stored. `visitorId` is a salted hash computed at
//     ingest (Services/utils/analytics.js) and the salt rotates daily, so two
//     visits a week apart cannot be joined back to one person, and the raw
//     address never reaches the database.
//   * No query strings. A path like /share/aBc123 is stored, but
//     ?email=someone@example.com is stripped at ingest — marketing links carry
//     addresses and they must not end up here.
//   * `userId` is only set for a signed-in session and is what makes the
//     per-user activity view possible. Anonymous rows stay anonymous.
//
// The TTL below is part of that: raw views are for recent behaviour, not a
// permanent record of who read what.

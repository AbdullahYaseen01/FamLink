// Everyone who finished the intake questions, whether or not we serve their
// area yet and whether or not they went on to create an account.
//
// This is a fourth capture collection and the duplication is deliberate, so
// here is why none of the existing three could answer the question:
//
//   Schema/onboardingLead.js  — only holds people who did NOT create an account,
//                               and is documented as write-only (never read back
//                               to a client), because it stores exact
//                               coordinates unprotected.
//   Schema/user.js            — only holds people who DID.
//   Schema/lead.js            — outbound prospects scraped for Slack triage.
//                               Never completed anything.
//
// The waitlist view needs the union, sorted and paged as one list, filtered by
// city, and exported. Doing that across two collections at query time means
// paging two cursors and merging in application code — which is where the
// "export all of Oakland" button quietly starts dropping rows. So capture
// writes here as well, and this collection is the one thing the admin screen
// reads.
//
// One row per email address. Someone who fills in the form, comes back a week
// later and then finally registers is one person on the waitlist, not three.

  // was waiting in Oakland and nothing about what they were waiting FOR, which
  // is the thing that decides whether two people on the list would actually
  // match each other.
  //
  // Stored twice on purpose:
  //
  //   `raw`     exactly as submitted, so nothing is lost to a parser that
  //             didn't anticipate a question added later.
  //   `answers` split into label/value pairs, because "filter everyone wanting
  //             full-time care in Oakland" is not a question a single string
  //             can answer. Indexed for $elemMatch.

// Someone who answered the intake questions but never created an account.
//
// The intake forms record their answers in a Google Sheet and then hand the
// visitor a questionnaire URL. That sheet is where the row lives, but it is not
// something the backend can query, so an abandoned signup was invisible to us:
// nothing here knew the person existed until they registered. This collection
// is the server-side copy that makes the drop-off addressable — it exists so
// Services/cron/onboardingNudge.js can find people who answered the questions,
// never finished, and still have no account (email 20).
//
// Deliberately a third lead model, alongside Schema/lead.js (outbound leads
// scraped for Slack triage) and Schema/resourceLead.js (Resource Center
// downloads). This one is a half-finished signup, has a resume link, and is
// consumed by a cron rather than answered immediately.
//
// PRIVACY: `location` carries the coordinates the visitor picked, and unlike
// User.location.coordinates it is NOT select:false. That is safe only because
// this collection is write-only from the public capture endpoint and is never
// serialised back to a client — the cron reads it in-process to pick nearby
// families and nothing else. Do not add a read route that returns these docs.

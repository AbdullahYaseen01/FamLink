// One record per message that tripped the content rules — the "Flagged" tab in
// the admin console reads this collection and nothing else.
//
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS IS NOT A FLAG ON THE MESSAGE DOCUMENT
//
// Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one.
//
// 1. Blocked messages were never delivered, so there is no message document to
//    hang a flag on — and a blocked attempt is the single most useful thing on
//    this screen, because it is someone who tried. Writing the attempt into
//    `messages` so it had somewhere to live would mean a row that must be
//    filtered out of every read path forever, and the first query that forgets
//    delivers the content this file exists to stop.
//
// 2. `content` here is a SNAPSHOT taken at send time, not a reference. The
//    sender can delete their message; an admin can delete it as moderation.
//    Either way the evidence of what was sent survives, which is what makes it
//    safe to remove abusive content promptly rather than after a review.
//
// A delivered-but-flagged message also gets `moderation.flagged` set on the
// message itself, so an admin reading the thread sees it in context. That is a
// marker for display. This collection is the record.
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// The launch announcement, written per city.
//
// The default templates (07/08) say "FamLink just launched near you". That is
// true everywhere and specific nowhere — and the whole point of opening a city
// at a time is that the message can name the neighbourhoods, quote what local
// families are paying, and come from whoever has been talking to them.
//
// So each city gets its own draft, saved between sessions. Without persistence
// an admin composing the Oakland email would lose it the moment they closed the
// dialog, which is the same as not having the feature.
//
// A city with no row here falls back to the built-in templates, so this is
// additive: nothing breaks if nobody ever writes a draft.

const launchEmailSchema = new Schema({
  // Lowercased on write and matched case-insensitively on read, because the

  // ("oakland") and both must reach the same draft.

  // classes, and class attributes do not survive the sanitiser — so storing
  // markup here would mean either weakening that filter or watching the
  // headline lose its styling on save. Empty means "use the standard wording",
  // per field, so a half-filled draft still renders a complete band.

  // keep in sync, the body may contain {{#member}}…{{/member}} and
  // {{#guest}}…{{/guest}} blocks, and only the matching one is kept per
  // recipient. A draft using neither goes to both unchanged.
  //
  // Sending the wrong one asks a long-standing member to sign up again.

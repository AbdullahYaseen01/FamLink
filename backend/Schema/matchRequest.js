  // long do requests sit unanswered" were both unanswerable from stored data.
  // Set alongside every status change in Controllers/match.controller.js.

  // Null on every request that predates this field, which the match-quality
  // report handles by measuring only rows that have it rather than treating a
  // missing timestamp as an instant response.

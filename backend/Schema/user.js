    // Opt-in only. This is the exact latitude and longitude of a home, in a
    // product used by families with young children and the people who care for
    // them, so it is the one field in the schema that must never travel by
    // accident.
    //
    // `select: false` inverts the default for any query that does not name the
    // address: a bare `findById(id)` no longer carries coordinates.
    //
    // Two rules follow from it, and getting the second one wrong takes the site
    // down, so read both before touching a projection here.
    //
    // 1. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN. Projecting the parent path —
    //    `select("location")`, i.e. `{ location: 1 }` — asks MongoDB for the
    //    whole subdocument, and an included parent overrides a child's
    //    `select: false`: the coordinates come back. That is why the
    //    outward-facing projection names the address subpath by subpath
    //    (PUBLIC_LOCATION_PATHS in Services/utils/userPrivacy.js) rather than
    //    selecting `location` whole.
    //
    // 2. NEVER SELECT THE PARENT AND `+location.coordinates` TOGETHER.
    //    `select("location +location.coordinates")` looks like the obvious way
    //    to opt in, and MongoDB REJECTS it: "Path collision at
    //    location.coordinates". The query throws, the route 500s, and the page
    //    goes blank. Rule 1 is why the `+` is unnecessary anyway — selecting
    //    the parent already returns them. Use `+location.coordinates` only when
    //    the parent is NOT in the projection (Controllers/mapPins.controller.js
    //    is the one such case).
    //
    // Matching is unaffected either way: $near / $geoWithin run against the
    // 2dsphere index and don't depend on the projection.

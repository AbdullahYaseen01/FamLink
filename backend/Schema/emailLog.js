// One row per automated email the platform attempts to send.
//
// This exists because "did she get the waitlist confirmation?" was previously
// unanswerable. The senders in Services/email/email.js hand their result to a
// `.catch(console.error)` and the evidence lives in a log file on a fly.io
// machine that gets replaced on every deploy. A support question about a
// missing email had no record to check against.
//
// Written by the transport wrapper (Services/email/emailLog.js), not by the
// individual senders, so an email added next month is logged without its author
// remembering to log it.
//
// NOT AN AUDIT LOG OF CONTENT. The rendered HTML is deliberately absent: these
// emails contain match details, children's ages and neighbourhood names, and a
// collection holding a year of them is a far worse thing to leak than the
// mailboxes it describes. What is stored is enough to answer "was it sent, to
// whom, when, and did the server accept it".

  // what the recipient will quote back to support, and it carries no private
  // detail that the `type` doesn't already imply.
  subject: { type: String, trim: true, default: "" },

  // accepted  — the SMTP server took it. This is the honest ceiling on what we
  //             can know from here; actual inbox delivery needs provider
  //             webhooks we don't consume yet.
  // failed    — the send threw. `error` says why.
  // skipped   — deliberately not sent: the recipient had unsubscribed, or the
  //             notification preference for this type was off. Recorded rather
  //             than dropped so "why didn't she get it" has an answer.

// The console's default view is "everything, newest first", filtered by type or

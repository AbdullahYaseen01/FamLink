// Nightly rollup of Schema/pageView.js, one row per calendar day.
//
// Two reasons this exists rather than aggregating raw views on every dashboard
// load. The first is cost: "traffic over the last 12 months" against the raw
// collection is a scan of every row the site has ever written, run again each
// time someone opens the page. The second is that it outlives them — raw views
// are deleted after 180 days by a TTL index, and the year-over-year trend has
// to survive that.
//
// Contains no visitor identifier of any kind. `uniqueVisitors` is a count
// computed at rollup time, not a set that could be intersected with anything,
// which is what makes it safe to keep indefinitely.

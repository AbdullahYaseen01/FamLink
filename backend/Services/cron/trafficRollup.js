// traffic chart against the raw collection scans every row the site has ever
// written. The less obvious one is that raw views are deleted after 180 days by
// a TTL index — so any history older than that exists ONLY if this job wrote
// it. A rollup that silently stops means history quietly disappears six months
// later, which is why the failure path logs loudly rather than passing.

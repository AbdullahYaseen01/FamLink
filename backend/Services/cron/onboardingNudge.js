// ── "You started but never signed up" nudge (email 20) ───────────────────────
// Emails someone who answered the intake questions on an onboarding form and
// then never created an account. Once each, a few hours after they dropped off.
//
// A lead is nudged when ALL of these hold:
//   • we haven't nudged them yet (nudgeSentAt is null)
//   • they haven't unsubscribed (unsubscribedAt is null)
//   • the lead is older than DELAY_HOURS but younger than WINDOW_DAYS
//   • no user account exists for that address
//
// DELAY_HOURS is the "a few hours later" of the spec, and it earns its keep:
// most people who finish the questions carry straight on to the account step,
// so mailing on the spot would nag people who were about to convert anyway.
// Registering also retires the lead directly (retireOnboardingLead, called from
// the signup path), so the users-collection check below is a backstop covering
// leads whose address signed up by some other route.
//
// The WINDOW_DAYS upper bound matters for the same reason it does in
// completeProfileReminder.js: without it the first run after deploy would mail
// the entire historical backlog at once. It also bounds retries — an address
// that keeps failing ages out of the window instead of being retried forever.

// ── Feedback request (email 15) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "How's it going?", asked once, of members who have been here long enough for
// the answer to mean something.
//
// Per the template's own trigger note: 30 days on the platform, and only if
// they are actually using it. Both halves matter — asking someone who signed up
// and never came back what they think of the product gets you silence, or an
// answer about a product they never saw.
//
// WHO QUALIFIES
//   • Signed up TENURE_DAYS–(TENURE_DAYS + WINDOW_DAYS) days ago.
//   • Has logged in at least once since signing up — the "active" half of the
//     trigger. A never-logged-in account is a re-engagement problem (email 16),
//     not a feedback one.
//   • Has been back recently enough to still have the product in mind: their
//     last login is inside the same window rather than on day one.
//   • Has not already been asked (`feedbackRequestSentAt`, once per account,
//     ever — see the schema note on why this one is never reset).
//   • Has not opted out of the newsletter. This is not transactional: nobody
//     needs to be told we would like their opinion, so it is gated like every
//     other non-essential send and the footer Unsubscribe suppresses it.
//
// WHY A WINDOW AND NOT "createdAt <= 30 days ago"
//
// The same reason reengagementReminder.js has one, and it is worth restating
// because getting it wrong is a single-run, unrecallable mistake: an open lower
// bound makes EVERY member who predates this file eligible on the first run,
// and the first deploy mails the entire back catalogue at once. The window
// means only people crossing the 30-day mark from here on are ever asked, and
// the backlog is never touched.
//
// The upper bound also bounds the damage from a bad run: at most WINDOW_DAYS of
// signups can be in scope at any time, not the whole table.

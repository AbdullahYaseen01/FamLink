// The canonical Terms & Conditions, as authored copy rather than as JSX.
//
// This is a verbatim transcription of what was hardcoded in
// `frontend/src/Components/Authority/Terms&Condition.jsx`. It exists so the
// admin console can load the live wording into its editor and publish it as
// version 1 — without that, an admin's first act would be retyping a
// twenty-section legal document from scratch.
//
// ── Why there are no class attributes ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The JSX carried its styling inline (`Livvic-SemiBold`, `border-l-[3px]
// border-[#CBD5E1]`, `list-disc ml-6`). None of that can survive here: the
// sanitiser in Services/utils/sanitizeHtml.js allows attributes on `<a>`,
// `<th>` and `<td>` only, so every `class` is stripped at publish. That is the
// correct behaviour and must not be loosened — an allow-list that accepts
// arbitrary attributes on arbitrary tags is most of the way to accepting an
// event handler.
//
// So the markup is semantic and the appearance comes from a stylesheet scoped
// to the rendering container (`.legal-document`), which both the public page
// and the admin preview apply. Same look, no attributes to sanitise:
//
//   <span class="Livvic-SemiBold">2.1 Heading.</span>   →  <strong>
//   <span class="Livvic-Bold">Famylink, Inc.</span>     →  <b>
//   <div class="border-l-[3px] …">Safety Notice</div>   →  <blockquote>
//   <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">                     →  <ul>
//
// `<strong>` and `<b>` both render bold by default, so the distinction is only
// visible via the stylesheet — 600 for the numbered clause labels, 700 for
// emphasis inside prose. That is exactly the split the JSX made, and keeping
// two tags means an editor can still express it.
//
// The title and the effective date are NOT in this string. They are columns on
// the terms document (Schema/terms.js), so the editor gives them their own
// inputs and the page renders them from metadata — a date buried in prose is a
// date that gets forgotten when a version is published.

export const DEFAULT_TERMS_TITLE = "Famlink Terms and Conditions";

// The dates the live page prints above the body:
//   "Effective Date: July 13, 2026  •  Last Updated: July 14, 2026"
//
// Kept here so the editor opens on the real dates rather than on today's, which
// would silently backdate — or forward-date — a contract the moment someone
// published without noticing the field.
//
// `updated` is only used before anything has been published. Once a version
// exists, "Last Updated" comes from that version's own timestamp, because the
// date a document changed is a fact about the document, not a field to type.

export const DEFAULT_TERMS_HTML = `<p>Welcome to <b>Famlink</b> — a platform built to help families and caregivers connect for nanny share arrangements. We believe that trust, transparency, and safety are the foundation of every great childcare relationship. These Terms and Conditions govern your use of our platform and are designed to be clear, fair, and protective of your rights.<br />By creating an account or using Famlink in any way, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the platform.</p>

<h2>1. About Famlink</h2>
<p>Famlink is operated by <b>Famylink, Inc.</b>, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware ("Famlink," "Company," "we," "us," or "our"). Famlink operates the platform accessible at www.famlink.care and any associated mobile applications, subdomains, or services (collectively, the "Platform").<br />Our mission is to make quality, affordable childcare accessible to more families by connecting them with compatible nanny share partners and caregivers in their local community.</p>

<h2>2. Nature of the Platform — Connection Service Only</h2>
<p><strong>2.1 Connection Platform Only.</strong> Famlink is a technology platform that provides tools enabling families and caregivers to discover one another, browse profiles, compare schedules and preferences, and initiate contact for the purpose of forming nanny share arrangements. Famlink is a <b>passive intermediary and connection service only</b>. Famlink does not employ caregivers, place caregivers with families, manage childcare arrangements, supervise any caregiver or child, or participate in any agreement between users.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 No Involvement in User Relationships.</strong> Any nanny share arrangement, childcare agreement, employment relationship, service contract, financial arrangement, or any other agreement formed between users through the Platform is solely between those users. Famlink is not a party to any such arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Section 230 Notice.</strong> Famlink is an interactive computer service as defined under 47 U.S.C. § 230 (the Communications Decency Act). Famlink is not the publisher or speaker of any User Content posted by users.</p>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<p>To create an account and use Famlink, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be at least 18 years of age;</li>
<li>Have the full legal capacity and authority to enter into a binding agreement;</li>
<li>Not be prohibited from using the Platform under any applicable federal, state, or local law; and</li>
<li>Provide truthful, accurate, and complete information during registration and at all times thereafter.</li>
</ul>
<p>By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you satisfy all eligibility requirements. Famlink reserves the right to refuse service to any person at any time for any reason.</p>

<h2>4. Account Registration and Security</h2>
<p><strong>4.1 Accuracy of Information.</strong> You agree to provide accurate, complete, and current information when creating your account and to update such information promptly if it changes. You may not create more than one account per person.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Credential Confidentiality</strong> You are solely and entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials, including your password and any one-time passcodes. You agree to notify Famlink immediately at support@famlink.care upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Account Activity</strong> You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, whether authorized by you or not.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Account Termination.</strong> Famlink reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or permanently terminate any account at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.</p>

<h2>5. Trust, Safety, and User Screening</h2>
<blockquote><strong>Important Safety Notice:</strong> Famlink does not conduct background checks or identity verification. You are responsible for independently screening any person you meet through the Platform before entering a childcare arrangement.</blockquote>

<p><strong>5.2 No Endorsement.</strong> The presence of a profile on Famlink does not constitute any endorsement, recommendation, verification, or approval by Famlink of that user’s identity, character, qualifications, or suitability for childcare</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Your Responsibility and Due Diligence.</strong> Famlink operates conceptually similar to a dating or social networking platform (such as Hinge, Bumble, or Raya) — we facilitate introductions, but we do not vet the people you meet. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to perform your own due diligence, just as you would when meeting anyone from the internet. You must independently investigate, verify, screen, and evaluate any person you encounter through the Platform before entering into any arrangement. This includes conducting your own background checks, verifying references, confirming identity, and verifying any claimed certifications. You must use common sense and personal judgment at all times.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Absolute Assumption of Risk.</strong> YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM AND YOUR DECISION TO INTERACT WITH, MATCH WITH, OR HIRE ANY USER IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND YOUR SOLE RISK. By using the Platform, you expressly acknowledge that you are assuming all risks — both known and unknown — associated with interacting with other users, including but not limited to any risks related to the safety, wellbeing, physical health, emotional welfare, or property of any child or adult. Famlink bears absolutely zero responsibility or liability for the actions, omissions, or conduct of anyone you hire, match with, or interact with through the Platform.</p>
<p><strong>5.5 Emergency Situations.</strong> If you believe you or a child is in immediate danger, contact local law enforcement immediately. Famlink is not a law enforcement agency and cannot guarantee the safety of any user.</p>

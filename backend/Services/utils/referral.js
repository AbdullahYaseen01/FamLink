// Caregiver referral rules.
//
// Caregivers — Nanny accounts whose profile has hasFamily === false — have no
// subscription. They get one free match request, and after that they keep
// matching by referring a friend: every friend who signs up with their code and
// completes a profile grants one calendar month. Refer someone each month and
// matching never lapses.
//
// The reward deliberately lands on profile completion rather than registration.
// Paying out at signup would make the whole scheme farmable with throwaway
// email addresses, and would reward referrals that bring no one real onto the
// platform. A referral therefore has two states — pending (signed up, profile
// unfinished) and credited (referralCreditedAt set on the referred user).

// public-origin filter as share links (publicUrl.js) rather than following
// FRONTEND_URL to localhost.

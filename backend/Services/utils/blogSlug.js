// resources email links to and what Google indexes. Two rules follow from that,
// and they are the whole of this file:
//
//   1. A slug is generated once, from the title, and then never changes.
//      Retitling "Nanny Share vs Daycare" to "Nanny Share or Daycare?" must not
//      move the article — every link already sent out would 404, and the search
//      ranking it accumulated would reset.
//
//   2. It must be unique, decided by the unique index rather than by a lookup.
//      A findOne check alone races two admins publishing at the same moment
//      onto one slug, and the loser's save then fails with a duplicate-key
//      error they cannot act on.

// "What Is a Nanny Share?" → "what-is-a-nanny-share"

// thing being logged — the account is blocked, the profile is gone. Letting a
// failed write bubble would turn a successful moderation action into a 500, the
// admin would retry, and the retry would run the cascade a second time. A
// missing audit row is a real cost; a double delete is a worse one.
//
// It is also deliberately awaited by its callers rather than fired and
// forgotten. The write is a single insert against an indexed collection, and
// the alternative is a response that returns before the trail records what it
// did — which is exactly the window an admin would use if they wanted an action
// to go unrecorded.

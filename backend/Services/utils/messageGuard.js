// The gate every outgoing message passes through.
//
// Sits between the two send paths (Routes/Socket/chat.js for the live app,
// Routes/message.js for the REST equivalent) and the database. Both used to
// write straight to `messages`, which meant the rules in messageModeration.js
// could be bypassed entirely by using the endpoint the app itself doesn't use —
// so the check lives here once and both callers await it.
//
// Four things are checked, in this order, because each is cheaper than the next
// and a failure of an earlier one makes the later ones moot:
//
//   1. Is the sender who they say they are, and in this conversation?
//   2. Is the message a sane size?
//   3. Are they sending faster than a person can type?
//   4. Does the content break the rules?
//
// (1) is not a content rule but belongs here for the same reason: it was the
// other half of "users can send whatever they want". The socket handler took
// `senderId` from the client payload and trusted it, so anyone with a browser
// console could post messages into any conversation as any member.

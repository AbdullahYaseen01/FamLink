// One function, used by both /admin/users and /admin/subscriptions, because a
// member reading "Free" on one screen and "Referral" on the other is a support

//
// ── Why "Referral" is a tier and not a footnote ───────────────────────────
//
// Caregivers have no subscription. They get one free match request, and after
// that they keep matching by referring a friend: each friend who signs up and
// completes a profile grants one calendar month, stamped on
// `referralMatchingUntil` (see Services/utils/referral.js).
//
// So an active referrer pays nothing AND is not on the free plan — they hold a
// paid-tier benefit that a free account does not have. Labelling them "Free"
// tells an admin the opposite of the truth: it reads as "this person has no
// benefits", when in fact they have earned benefits that expire on a date, and
// that date is the single most useful thing to know about the account. It is
// also what makes "why did this caregiver stop matching?" answerable at a
// glance instead of by reading the referral collection.

 * cancelled subscription leaves `premium` true until the period ends, and a
 * past-due one is neither free nor reliably paying.

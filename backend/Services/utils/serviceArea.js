// unified (frontend/src/Config/serviceArea.js). It has to exist here too
// because the waitlist screen answers "who is outside the radius", and a gate
// that only exists in the browser can't answer anything about stored data — nor
// be trusted, since the client decides what it sends.
//
// THESE TWO LISTS MUST AGREE. When a city opens, edit both. They are kept as
// separate files rather than one shared module because the frontend build does
// not reach into backend/, and a copied constant with a comment is a smaller
// problem than a build-time dependency between the two halves of the repo.

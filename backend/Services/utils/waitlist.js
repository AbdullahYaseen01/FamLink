// FamLink's email policy is opt-OUT, everywhere and for everyone: we may email
// you until you tell us not to. This is the one place that decides what that
// means for a given row, and every consumer goes through it.
//
//   has an account → consented if subscribed to EITHER of the two categories
//                    in Schema/user.js. Both are ON from signup and an absent
//                    flag means on as well (the $ne:false rule every send path
//                    already uses), so this is a Yes until they switch one off
//                    in Settings → Email Notifications. One category is enough:
//                    the two are different kinds of mail, and someone who kept
//                    either has not opted out of hearing from us.
//   no account     → yes. They handed us their address in one of our own
//                    funnels and have never asked us to stop.
//   either         → `unsubscribedAt` on the row overrules both. Withdrawal
//                    outranks every other signal.
//
// `notifyConsent` as STORED answers a narrower question — did this person tick
// the box on the waitlist form — and it survives as provenance only, carried
// through as `formConsent`. It is deliberately no longer what decides a send:
// the box was on a form most of these people never saw. Registration doesn't
// show it, so members sat at false while the account they hold said they were
// subscribed to everything; leads are captured mid-questionnaire, so they sat
// at false too. The flag was describing our forms, not the people.
//
// A deleted account never resolves to consented, and does NOT fall through to
// the no-account rule. Two of the three delete paths clear the email flags;
// Routes/admin/reports.js does not, and reading a tombstone as permission to
// email is not a risk worth carrying.

// Every field the API sends reaches the browser's network tab, so "the UI
// doesn't render it" is not privacy — the only thing that keeps a field private
// is not selecting it. Routes used to hand out whole user documents behind a
// blacklist (`.select("-password -otp ...")`), which silently leaks every field
// added to the schema afterwards: that is how exact home coordinates, email
// addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and Stripe customer ids ended up in
// the browse and profile responses.
//
// So the policy here is a whitelist, in three tiers:
//
//   SECRET   — never leaves the server for anyone, not even the account owner.
//              Enforced a second time by the schema's toJSON transform.
//   PRIVATE  — the owner (and an Admin acting through the admin console) may
//              see it; another member never may.
//   PUBLIC   — what one member may learn about another.
//
// Anything new on the user schema is private by default: it has to be added to
// PUBLIC_USER_FIELDS on purpose before it can reach another member.

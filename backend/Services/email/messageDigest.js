// ── New-message email batching (email 06) ────────────────────────────────────
// The template's developer note: "Batch if multiple messages arrive within
// 15 min to avoid notification spam — send one digest email."
//
// So instead of emailing on every message, the first message to an offline user
// opens a 15-minute window. Any further messages that land in that window just
// update the window (they don't queue another email). When the window closes we
// send a single email showing the most recent message, and the subject reflects
// how many arrived.
//
// Before sending we re-check the recipient: if they came online during the
// window they've already seen the messages, so we drop the email entirely. Same
// if they turned the "New Messages" email notification off.
//
// NOTE: the window is held in memory, so it is per-process. On a multi-instance
// deploy a user could receive one digest per instance that handled a message —
// still bounded, and far better than one email per message. Set
// MESSAGE_EMAIL_WINDOW_MS=0 to send immediately instead.
